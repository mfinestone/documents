## Circulating Supply

The current circulationg supply is 734,089,390 LRC, 52.6% of the total LRC supply.

**NOTE:**
**There is a discrepancy regarding the circulating supply between this document (734,089,390 LRC) and [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com) (561,167,415 LRC as of Jan 17, 2018). This is because we use different standards; the Loopring Foundation considers the LEAF fund as part of the circulating supply although only a portion of it is actually in circulation.**

The foundation controls the following addresses:
