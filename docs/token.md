The following addresses contain LRC that are burned by either the foundation or some users (Nobody can transfer these LRC out to another address).

Address  | LRC Balance
------------- | -------------:|
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 (blackhole)	|	20,000,000	|

Additionally, several institute addresses collectively hold about 118,626,980 LRC that are not suppose to circulate within a year. We cannot list these addresses.

We also have two incentive plan addresses. The first one is the mid-term plan whose LRC may be unlock in about a year; the second address is for the long-term plan whose LRC won't be unlocked until 18 months later.
