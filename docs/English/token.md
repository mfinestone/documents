## Circulating Supply

The current circulating supply is 734,089,390 LRC, 52.6% of the total LRC supply.

**NOTE:**
**There is a discrepancy regarding the circulating supply between this document (734,089,390 LRC) and [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com) (561,167,415 LRC as of Jan 17, 2018). This is because we use different standards; the Loopring Foundation considers the LEAF fund as part of the circulating supply although only a portion of it is actually in circulation.**

The foundation controls the following addresses:

|Address  | LRC Balance|
|------------- | -------------:|
0x7B22713f2e818fad945AF5a3618a2814F102cbe0 (iceboxm, circulating in 2 years) |   279,015,212 |
0xB7bb1E956beF65F22B32b04f230159040Dcb1829  |   1,924,388 |

0x85e64Df825c6397904Fe4A366629112079C64858  |   48,214,413  |
SUB-TOTAL   |   425,479,956 |   

The following addresses contain LRC that are burned by either the foundation or some users (Nobody can transfer these LRC out to another address).

|Address  | LRC Balance|
|------------- | -------------:|
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000  |   20,000,000  |
0xEF68e7C694F40c8202821eDF525dE3782458639f (LRC Token Contract)   |   119,186 |
SUB-TOTAL   |   20,119,186  |   

Additionally, the following LRC are not under our control but will not circulate until their respective stated times.

|Address  | LRC Balance|
|------------- | -------------:|
[addresses not available] (institutional investors, circulating after Sept 2018)  |   100,065,000 |
0x239dE3a0D6ca5f21601f83327eA2174225eB7156 (long-term plan, circulating after  March 2019)  |   115,322,523 |
 SUB-TOTAL  |   215,387,523 |


We consider the aforementioned three groups of LRC not in circulation, therefore we have:


|Address Group  | LRC Balance| Percentage|
|------------- | -------------:|-------------:|
Foundation  |   425,479,956   |   30.5%
Burned  |   20,119,186  |   1.4%

Circulating Supply (including LEAF and mid-term incentive plan, see below)|    734,089,390 |   52.6%
**Total Supply**    |   <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xEF68e7C694F40c8202821eDF525dE3782458639f">1,395,076,054</a>   |   **100.0%**
 
[LEAF (Loopring Ecosystem Advancement Fund)](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-2018-rnd-roadmap-33b423526669)  was set up to support the development of the Loopring ecosystem. Currently 16.8% of the total supply was put into LEAF, and we will put an additional 3.2% in the next four years.
